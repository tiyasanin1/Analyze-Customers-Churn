# Hands On Data Science Project with Python: Data Manipulation

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at demonstrating skills in data manipulation using Python. The focus is on cleaning, transforming, and exploring datasets using popular libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

## Objectives
- Perform data manipulation processes such as cleaning, standardizing, and transforming data.
- Demonstrate data melt and unmelt techniques.
- Explore the dataset to answer key questions based on the analysis.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Assignment Breakdown
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Import necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy).
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file.

2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Identify and handle missing or erroneous data.
   - Standardize data where needed.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Apply melt and unmelt (pivot) functions.
   - Use transformations like scaling, normalization, or applying mathematical functions.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
   - Answer specific questions about the dataset, such as finding the maximum, mean, or other statistics.

## Files in Repository
